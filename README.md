# Introductory and basic examples in C language

Some examples are presented to illustrate the usage of conditional compilation,
libraries, pointers and other cool stuff that C allows one to do.



## Requirements

The examples were tested in a Linux (Ubuntu distro 16.04.1, kernel
4.15.0-36-generic) with GCC version 5.4.0 20160609.
