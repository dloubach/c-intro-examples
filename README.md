# Introductory and basic examples in C language

Some examples are presented to illustrate the usage of conditional compilation,
libraries, pointers and other cool stuff that C allows one to do.



## How to run the examples

Each folder contains one different example. So, just enter the desired folder
and look directly to the source code, which is fortunately with comments.

Use `gcc file.c -o executable` to generate an executable file in the
command-line interface. Then, just do `./executable`.


Always observe the outputs in the compilation process, in case of any _warning_ or
even _error_.


## Requirements

The examples were tested in a Linux (Ubuntu distro 16.04.1, kernel
4.15.0-36-generic) with GCC version 5.4.0 20160609.
